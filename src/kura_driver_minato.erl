-module(kura_driver_minato).
-moduledoc """
`kura_driver` implementation over [minato](https://hex.pm/packages/minato).

## Where a query goes

Outside a transaction it goes to the pool: `minato:query/4` borrows a
connection, runs the statement and gives it back, all inside the call. Nothing
is held and nothing is threaded through kura.

Inside a transaction it goes to the connection the transaction is running on,
which `m:kura_pool_minato` holds and this module finds in the process
dictionary. The reason is that a query written inside `transaction/4`'s
function is handed nothing, so the connection has to be found rather than
passed.

## Results and errors

minato answers `#{command := atom(), num_rows := integer(), rows := [row()]}`,
which is the shape kura already reads, and a failing statement answers `{error,
{pgsql_error, Fields}}` with `code` and `constraint` as binaries - which is what
`kura_repo_worker` turns into a changeset error. Nothing in kura had to change
for either.

## numeric

`numeric` decodes to a float here, which is not minato's default: minato hands
back the exact decimal text, because that is what the type is for. kura has
always given callers a float for it, through `pg_types`, and a driver swap is
the wrong moment to change what `avg/1` returns for everybody.

A repo that wants the exact form says `numeric_format => binary` in its driver
options, and should, for anything that is money.

## Transaction control in user SQL

A `COMMIT`, `END` or `ROLLBACK` run through `query/5` inside `transaction/4`
ends the transaction behind kura's back. Every statement there goes to the
transaction's holder, which reads the transaction status the server sends in
`ReadyForQuery` after it, and the statement's command tag. A statement that
leaves the connection `idle`, or answers with the tag `COMMIT`, raises
`error({kura_driver_minato, transaction_ended_by_statement})`. Whatever it
committed stays committed. From then on the holder refuses every statement meant
for the transaction without sending it to the server: a statement run by a
function that caught the error raises the same, so do the `COMMIT`, `SAVEPOINT`
and `RELEASE` that `transaction/4` would send, and the `ROLLBACK` and
`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` it would clean up with are skipped. No work meant for
the transaction runs outside it.

The status and the tag are read rather than the SQL text, so a statement is
caught however it is spelled. The tag is what catches `COMMIT AND CHAIN`, which
leaves a new transaction open, so the connection never reads as `idle`; that
transaction is rolled back when the connection is checked in.
`ROLLBACK AND CHAIN` and `ABORT AND CHAIN` answer with the tag `ROLLBACK`, as
`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` does. `transaction/4` begins with a transaction-local
setting sent in the same round trip as its `BEGIN`, and only a statement tagged
`ROLLBACK` that leaves the connection in a transaction is followed by one more
query to read it back, under the statement's `timeout`: a savepoint rollback
keeps the setting, a chained rollback has replaced the transaction and lost it,
and raises the same error. A `RESET ALL` inside the transaction clears the
setting too, so a later `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`, including the one a nested
`transaction/4` cleans up with, raises `transaction_ended_by_statement` while the
transaction is still open. Avoid `RESET ALL` inside `transaction/4`.

This covers transactions `transaction/4` opens. A sandboxed test runs its
statements through `query_on/4`, which does not check.

## Timeouts

`timeout` in the driver options is a deadline on the statement rather than on
the read. minato cancels a statement that outlives it on the server and reads
the cancellation through, so a slow query comes back as SQLSTATE `57014` and the
connection goes back to the pool rather than being closed.

Run `Fun` inside a transaction.

`BEGIN` first, `COMMIT` on a normal return, `ROLLBACK` on an exception, which is
then re-raised. Queries inside `Fun` find the connection through the process
dictionary.

Raises `error(transaction_rolled_back)` when the server answers the `COMMIT`
with `ROLLBACK`, which it does when the transaction had already failed. Nothing
was written, and returning the function's value there would report success for
work the server threw away.

Called again from the same process inside a transaction on the same pool, it
runs `Fun` on that transaction's connection under a `SAVEPOINT`: a normal return
releases it, and an exception rolls back to it and is re-raised, leaving the
work before it in place. A nested transaction therefore commits only with the
outer one. Here `transaction_rolled_back` means a statement inside `Fun` failed
and only the nested work was undone: the outer transaction is still open and
may catch it and carry on. A process spawned from `Fun` is outside the
transaction, and its own `transaction/4` is an independent outermost one.

Other failures raise `error({kura_driver_minato, {Failure, Reason}})`:

- `begin_failed` or `savepoint_failed`: the transaction or savepoint could not
  start, and `Fun` did not run.
- `commit_failed` or `release_failed`: the server refused it, so nothing in
  that transaction or savepoint was kept.
- `commit_unknown`: no answer came back, for example on a timeout or a lost
  connection, so the server may or may not have committed.
- `rollback_to_failed`: a nested `Fun` raised and the server refused the
  `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`, for example because `Fun` released the savepoint
  itself. The whole transaction is rolled back rather than keep work the nested
  call was meant to undo, and anything run in it afterwards raises
  `transaction_ended_by_statement`.
- `no_connection`: no connection could be checked out, and `Fun` did not run.

`error({kura_driver_minato, transaction_ended_by_statement})` when a statement
run inside `Fun`, such as a raw `COMMIT`, `END` or `ROLLBACK`, ended the
transaction. Whatever it committed stays committed and nothing after it runs.
Nested, it is raised the same way: the statement ended the outermost
transaction, not just the savepoint.

A server error is reduced to its `code`, `constraint`, `severity` and
`severity_non_localised`, since its message and detail can carry row values.
